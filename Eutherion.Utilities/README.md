# Eutherion.Utilities

Contains miscellaneous .NET utilities:

  * _TextFormatter_, allowing formatting methods to be defined for keys and a variable number of parameters.
  * _SafeLazy<TValue>_ and _SafeLazyObject<TObject>_, which lazily initialize values based on two different asynchronous initialization patterns.
  * _EnumValues<TEnum>_, which stores a list of declared enumeration values in memory and behaves like a regular list.
  * _ImplementationSet<TInterface>_, to manage a set of objects keyed by their type, that all share a common base class or interface.
